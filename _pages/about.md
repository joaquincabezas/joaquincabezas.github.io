Hello! My name is Joaqu√≠n Cabezas, and I am pursuing a PhD in machine learning and network science. My research focuses on evolving social and economic environments, which I study with methods and tools associated with dynamic graphs and time series (i.e. [Temporal Graph Networks](https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/insights/2021/temporal-graph-networks){:target="\_blank"}, [pytorch-geometric-temporal](https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki/pytorch_geometric_temporal){:target="\_blank"}).

My work is closely related to concepts like geometric deep learning, graph neural networks and representation learning. On top of this, a critical aspect is interpretability, due to the nature of Social Data Science itself.

I am lucky to be advised by Jordi Duch and Sergio Gomez of the [Alephsys Lab](https://alephsyslab.com/){:target="\_blank"} at Universitat Rovira i Virgili.
